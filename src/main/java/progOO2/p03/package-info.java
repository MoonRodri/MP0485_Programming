/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: Dog</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package serves as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),
 * focusing on the definition and use of <b>attributes</b> within a class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key learning goals:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Class definition</b>: The {@code Dog} class demonstrates how to define a basic class in Java.</li>
 *   <li><b>Attributes (fields)</b>: Students learn how to declare and use instance variables such as {@code name}, {@code breed}, and {@code age}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation (initial exposure)</b>: Although not yet enforced with accessors/mutators, the use of {@code private} fields introduces the idea of data hiding.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This step lays the groundwork for later concepts like constructors, methods,
 * and behavior abstraction, which will be added in subsequent exercises.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The included class {@code Dog} is a template and should be
 * completed by the student.</p>
