/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: Room</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package introduces a key object-oriented programming concept: the use of
 * <b>constructors with parameters</b> to initialize object attributes upon creation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key learning goals:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Class definition</b>: The {@code Room} class defines a simple real-world entity with properties like {@code code} and {@code seats}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Parameterized constructor</b>: Students learn to initialize object fields using constructor parameters, reinforcing the connection between class structure and real data.</li>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation (progressive)</b>: Fields are declared as {@code private}, introducing controlled access and preparation for methods and accessors.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package builds on previous exercises involving attributes and lays the foundation
 * for object instantiation and constructor chaining.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The included {@code Room} class is part of a guided exercise and may be expanded with methods or accessors in later steps.</p>
