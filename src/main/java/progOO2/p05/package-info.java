/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: Whistle</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package continues the introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),
 * emphasizing how to define a <b>constructor with parameters</b> and how to create
 * <b>methods that represent object behavior</b>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key learning goals:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Parameterized constructor</b>: The {@code Whistle} class uses a constructor to initialize the {@code sound} attribute when a new object is created.</li>
 *   <li><b>Behavior through methods</b>: The {@code sound()} method demonstrates how objects can perform actions, in this case, printing a specific sound to the console.</li>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation</b>: The attribute {@code sound} is private, reinforcing the principle of keeping internal data hidden and accessed only via methods.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This exercise builds upon earlier concepts and helps students understand how
 * real-world objects can be modeled with both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The {@code Whistle} class is part of a hands-on learning activity and may be expanded or reused in other object interaction exercises.</p>
