/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II:  YourFirstAccount</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package introduces the fundamental concepts of
 * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through a simple class:
 * {@code Account}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key concepts applied:</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation</b>: the fields {@code balance} and {@code owner}
 *       are declared private to protect the internal state of the object.</li>
 *   <li><b>Methods</b>: operations such as {@code deposit()},
 *       {@code withdrawal()} and {@code saldo()} allow controlled
 *       interaction with the object's data.</li>
 *   <li><b>Constructor</b>: the constructor initializes an account with
 *       a specific owner and starting balance.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code toString()} override</b>: the method is overridden to
 *       provide a custom textual representation of the object.</li>
 *   <li><b>Abstraction</b>: the class models a simplified bank account,
 *       hiding implementation details from the user.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Important:</b> This code is protected and must not be modified,
 * as it serves as a foundation for structured OOP learning.</p>
