/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: Product</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package reinforces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
 * by combining a <b>constructor with parameters</b> and a method to
 * display object data. It models a real-world object: a product in a store.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key learning goals:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Parameterized constructor</b>: The {@code Product} class uses a constructor to initialize multiple attributes: {@code name}, {@code price}, and {@code quantity}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Multiple fields</b>: This class includes several private fields to represent the state of a product, supporting the idea of more complex data modeling.</li>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation</b>: The attributes are declared {@code private}, reinforcing data protection and preparation for future accessor methods.</li>
 *   <li><b>Printing object state</b>: The {@code printProduct()} method introduces how to output an object's internal state in a user-friendly format.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This exercise connects class structure to practical applications like inventory or store systems,
 * and prepares students for more advanced object manipulation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The {@code Product} class may be extended later with methods to update price or quantity, or to support user interaction.</p>
