/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: YourFirstBankTransfer </h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package continues to reinforce essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
 * concepts using the {@code Account} class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Core OOP Concepts Illustrated:</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation</b>: The fields {@code balance} and {@code owner}
 *       are declared {@code private} to restrict direct access and protect the object’s state.</li>
 *   <li><b>Constructor</b>: A parameterized constructor initializes
 *       the account with an owner name and initial balance.</li>
 *   <li><b>Method Definition</b>: The class defines clear public methods
 *       such as {@code deposit()}, {@code withdrawal()}, and {@code saldo()}
 *       to manipulate and retrieve internal data in a controlled way.</li>
 *   <li><b>Method Overriding</b>: {@code toString()} is overridden to provide
 *       a meaningful string representation of the account’s data.</li>
 *   <li><b>Abstraction</b>: The implementation details of how the balance is stored
 *       or updated are hidden from the user of the class.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This class is protected and should not be modified,
 * as it is part of a guided learning module on proper OOP design practices.</p>
