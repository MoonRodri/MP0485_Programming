/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: Door</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package introduces the concept of a <b>constructor without parameters</b>
 * in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside reinforcing the idea that
 * objects can have behaviors represented by methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key learning goals:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>No-argument constructor</b>: The {@code Door} class includes a constructor with no parameters, showing that an object can be instantiated with default values or behaviors.</li>
 *   <li><b>Method to define behavior</b>: The {@code knock()} method simulates an action that a door can perform, encouraging students to think about how real-world behaviors can be modeled in code.</li>
 *   <li><b>Basic encapsulation</b>: While no attributes are present yet, the class structure supports the idea of defining private data in the future.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package complements previous exercises by demonstrating how not all constructors need parameters,
 * and how methods can be used to express meaningful behavior even in simple classes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The {@code Door} class is a foundational example and may be extended in future exercises with state (e.g., open/closed).</p>
