/**
 * <h2>Programming Object Oriented II: Song</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package focuses on introducing the concept of returning values from methods.
 * The {@code Song} class models a simple song with a name and a length in seconds.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key learning goals:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Returning values</b>: The {@code name()} and {@code length()} methods return data stored in private fields.</li>
 *   <li><b>Encapsulation</b>: The fields {@code name} and {@code length} are private and final, encouraging proper encapsulation and immutability.</li>
 *   <li><b>Constructor parameters</b>: Students learn to initialize object state using parameters passed to a constructor.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This exercise helps students distinguish between methods that perform actions and those that simply return internal state,
 * and prepares them to write more complex accessor and utility methods.
 * </p>
