# 📘 Java Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn **basic Java programming concepts** through a series of progressively organized packages and examples.

## 📚 Project Structure

The source code is divided into multiple packages covering key topics:

- `main.java.prog1`: Structured Programming I  
  Data types, operators, type casting, statements, flow control, and comments.

- `main.java.prog2`: Structured Programming II  
  Predefined classes (e.g., arrays), debugging with breakpoints, exception handling, and JavaDoc.

- `main.java.progOO1`: Object-Oriented Programming I  
  Methods, Strings, StringBuilder, ArrayList, wrapper classes.

- `main.java.progOO2.p01` to `p10`: Object-Oriented Programming II  
  Real-world examples: bank account, transfer, dog, room, whistle, door, product, counter, debt, and song.

## 📄 JavaDoc

To explore the documentation of each class and package, **open the generated JavaDoc**:

👉 [View JavaDoc Overview](./dist/javadoc/index.html)

This documentation includes descriptions of all methods, fields, and classes. It helps you understand how each piece of the code works and is useful when writing your own programs.

## ✅ Testing with JUnit

Some exercises include **unit tests written with JUnit**. These tests are placed inside the same packages as the Java classes they test (e.g., `main.java.prog1`).

### ▶️ Running a Single JUnit Test

To execute tests **one by one**, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in **NetBeans** or another Java IDE that supports JUnit.
2. In the project tree, navigate to the test file you want to run. For example:
src/
└── main/java/prog1/
└── P01_SandboxTest.java
3. Right-click on the test file (e.g., `P01_SandboxTest.java`).
4. Select **Run File** or **Run JUnit Test File** from the context menu.
5. Check the **Test Results window** for output and assertion feedback.
